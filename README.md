# SDG Scholar
**SDG Scholar** is an interactive web application designed to educate users about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through educational resources and quizzes. Authorized users, such as admins, can make announcements and manage SDG-related content, providing student learning flexibility.

### Project Status
SDG Scholar is still under development with the current version focusing on **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**. Users can explore SDG 11 target-specific content through a city-scape view. Future developments should include the other SDGs and new features (e.g. awards/badges) to enhance the learning experience.
